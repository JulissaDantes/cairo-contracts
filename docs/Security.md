 ## Reentrancy Guard 
 
A reentrancy attack occurs when the caller is able to obtain more resources than allowed by recursively calling a targetâ€™s function.

Since Cairo does not support modifiers like Solidity, the `reentrancy_guard` library exposes two functions `ReentrancyGuard_start` and `ReentrancyGuard_end` to protect functions against reentrancy attacks. The protected function must call `ReentrancyGuard_start` before the first function statement, and `ReentrancyGuard_end` before the return statement.
