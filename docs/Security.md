 ## Reentrancy Guard 
 
 A reentrancy attack occurs when the caller is able to obtain more resources than allowed by recursively calling a targetâ€™s function. Unlike the Solidity, cairo does not support modifiers, so instead, to deal with reentrancy attacks, we have a cairo contract, reentrancy_guard.cairo with two functions `ReentrancyGuard_start` and `ReentrancyGuard_end`. The protected function must be called `ReentrancyGuard_start` before the first function statement, and `ReentrancyGuard_end` before the return statement.
